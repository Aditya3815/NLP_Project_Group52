# 🧠 NLP Project – Sentiment Analysis

## 📚 Description

This project is focused on **Sentiment Analysis** to understand the overall sentiment of product reviews — whether people liked a product or not. It uses a mix of lexicon-based and machine learning-based approaches to detect sentiments, including tools like **VADER**, **TextBlob**, and **custom ML models**.

## 🚀 Tasks Performed

- Sentiment analysis using **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
- Preprocessing of text data using NLP techniques
- Training and evaluation of multiple classifiers (like Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Visualization of sentiment scores and word clouds
- Use of both lexicon-based and supervised ML methods

## 🧪 Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install matplotlib nltk numpy pandas scikit-learn spacy tensorflow textblob tqdm vaderSentiment wordcloud
```

> Note: You may also need to download additional NLP corpora for NLTK and spaCy (e.g., `punkt`, `vader_lexicon`, and `en_core_web_sm`).
